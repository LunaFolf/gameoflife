# I got bored, and created another Game of Life.
Sorry, not sorry.

I haven't actually created a Conway's Game of Life project since I was in school, doing it for my mock Exams.

I had some time to kill, and thought it would be fun to revist it and just tinker with different ideas on how to implement it and certain features.

Missing features, that will probably never come:
* Walls don't loop back around, they are a void...
* Not getting stuck in loops.
